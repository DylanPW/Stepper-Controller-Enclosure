|Item|QTY|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|ZK-SMC02|1| |
|Arduino Nano w/ headers|1| |
|5x7cm 2.54mm Proto-PCB|1|Hole spacing specific to the generic green type|
|ACS712 Current Sensor|1|30A version used here, though 5A variant would suit better. Reccommend calibrating sensor regardless in the Arduino code|
|Smart Electronics DC 0-25V Voltage Sensor|1|Remove screw terminal|
|0.42" I2C OLED (72x40) SSD1306|1|Requires mounting points in the PCB|
|54x9x2mm Clear Acrylic|1|Easily replaced, adjust retainer to suit what you have.|
|KF-301 4P Terminal Block Connector|1|I used 2x 2P connectors, 4P would be better|
|JST-XH 2P Socket|1| |
|JST-XH 2P Connector & Pins|1| |
|JST-XH 4P Socket|2| |
|JST-XH 4P Right Angle Socket|1|Used for LCD, can be substituted for standard right angle header.|
|JST-XH 4P Connector & Pins|3| |
|3 pin 2.54mm header|3|Two used for voltage sensor mounting, one of those will need the center pin removed.|
|3 pin 2.54mm Female Dupont Connector & pins|2| |
|4 pin 2.54mm header|1| |
