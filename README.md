# Stepper Controller Enclosure
CAD Files & Arduino Code for a 3D Printed Enclosure for the ZK-SMC02 Stepper Driver. Features current and voltage monitoring.

Uses an Arduino Nano, 70x40 0.42" I2C LCD, ACS712 Voltage Sensor (30A in my case), and a voltage sensor module.

Voltage and current measurements were fine for my purposes but were still inaccurate compared to my multimeter. You get what you pay for.

Enclosure fits the Stepper Controller unit, and a 5x7cm proto-pcb with screw terminals, JST-XH and header pins exposed. There is a slot for a label. STEP file is included as other hardware will require remixing.
